Justifications, for management, always come down to dollars not technology so here are your justifications.

1. Single location storing backup metadata for all databases saves money be limiting the amount of time spent verifying backups were successful.
2. The Metadata repository provides a single audit trail of all backups and clones reducing the time and cost of keeping accurate audit records.
3. By using documented "best practices" we reduce our liability by being able to demonstrate we follow Oracle recommendations.
4. By storing universal configuration information in the repository we reduce the time spent validating new backup configurations and rolling them
out to multiple databases on multiple servers which saves money.
5. By using the latest technology it enhances our ability to attract and retain top talent.

Never make a technology argument when you can make a financial argument.
